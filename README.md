# Notes:

Token expires after 24hrs
Rate limiting limits api calls to 100 requests per 15 minutes
Use form-data body format when using the register and create post endpoints because they accept image files which need to be in a multi data format which json cannot handle properly.

Please reach out to me for any clarifications or issues, thank you.
